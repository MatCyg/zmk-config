- One shot layer leverages &tog because &sl won't allow for shortcuts, i.e. CMD + n
- NUM_APP_LOWER_COPY exist because otherwise CMD/CTRL -> num app doesn't work because &mo takes layer position into consideration. The problem doesn't exist for sym layer because it is allowed to press i.e. CMD+ALT+V
